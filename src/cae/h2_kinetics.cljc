  "Generic metal-hydride hydrogen DESORPTION KINETICS (transient screening).

  System context: the magnesium-hydrogen-PEMFC electric-drive boundary
  (scripts/hermes-magnesium-systems-bots/system-scope.edn) names a
  `:controlled-hydrogen-reactor`. The equilibrium contract
  (`:h2-desorption`, van't Hoff plateau) answers *whether* and *at what
  pressure* a bed desorbs; it cannot answer *how fast* — which is what
  reactor control and fuel-cell supply scheduling need. This contract is
  the smallest transient step in that direction.

  Genericity / provenance discipline (mirrors `cae.industrial/h2-desorption`):
  - The hydride identity, Arrhenius pre-exponential factor `:rate-A-per-s`
    and activation energy `:activation-energy-J-mol` are CALLER-SUPPLIED
    with a mandatory non-blank `:kinetics-source` provenance string. The
    contract FAILS CLOSED without it: unprovenanced kinetic data must
    never enter a case.
  - The equilibrium plateau pressure is a caller-supplied input
    (`:equilibrium-pressure-Pa`), typically obtained from the
    `:h2-desorption` equilibrium contract at the same bed temperature —
    this namespace never recomputes thermodynamics and bakes in no
    Mg/MgH2 constants.
  - The only default number is the CODATA 2018 exact molar gas constant
    (a physical unit constant, not a material property).

  Model (constant T and P over the window — a screening assumption that
  is carried on every result):
      k(T)   = A · exp(−Ea / (R·T))                       [1/s]
      θ      = max(0, 1 − P/P_eq)                          [dimensionless driving force]
      dx/dt  = k(T) · θ · (1 − x)                          first-order in remaining fraction
  integrated by explicit Euler over `:time-s` with step `:dt-s`. Because
  T, P and θ are constant over the window this admits the closed form
      x(t) = 1 − (1 − x0) · exp(−k(T) · θ · t)
  and every result carries `:analytic-fraction-released` plus the numeric
  solution, so the caller sees the discretization error directly (and a
  `:dt-refinement-rel-diff` between dt and dt/2 runs as convergence
  evidence). No hysteresis, slope factor, bed thermal mass, pressure
  ramp or heat-transfer coupling is modeled — all of that remains
  explicitly unmeasured here."

  "Transient first-order metal-hydride desorption screening over one window

  Case keys:
  - `:temperature-K` — bed temperature (required, positive).
  - `:pressure-Pa` — ambient hydrogen pressure at the bed (required, positive).
    Desorption proceeds only while this is below the equilibrium pressure;
    above it the driving force is clamped to zero (absorption is NOT modeled).
  - `:equilibrium-pressure-Pa` — plateau pressure at `:temperature-K`
    (required, positive; caller-supplied so the equilibrium contract owns
    the thermodynamics).
  - `:rate-A-per-s` — Arrhenius pre-exponential factor (required, positive).
  - `:activation-energy-J-mol` — activation energy (required, positive).
  - `:kinetics-source` — non-blank provenance string for A and Ea
    (required; fail-closed without it).
  - `:time-s` — window length (required, positive).
  - `:dt-s` — explicit Euler step (required, positive; must not exceed `:time-s`).
  - `:initial-fraction-released` — x0 in [0, 1] (default 0.0).
  - Optional capacity group (all-or-none): `:hydride-mass-kg`,
    `:molar-mass-hydride-kg-mol`, `:molar-mass-h2-kg-mol`,
    `:h2-per-formula-unit` — same stoichiometry contract as the
    `:h2-desorption` equilibrium model; when present, the released H2 mass
    is reported as `:released-h2-mass-kg` (fraction-released × capacity).

  Returns a `:screening-only` result with the rate constant, driving force,
  numeric and analytic fraction released, dt-refinement relative difference,
  and the explicit unmeasured envelope (hysteresis, slope, thermal mass,
  pressure ramp, heat transfer, absorption)."
